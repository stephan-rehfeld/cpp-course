# C++ Course

## Synopsis

This is a C++ course that will be held at the Beuth-University of Applied Sciences in Berlin, Germany in 
2019/2010. It is designed for fourth semeter students that already can program and have learned programming
in Java or C#. The course will show similarities and differences to Java and C#. It is not designed to teach
the whole C++ language, as this would not be possible within one semester. Instead it is designed to give a
first overview about which programming principles are supported by C++, how "to solve problems the C++ way",
and how to gain performance.
